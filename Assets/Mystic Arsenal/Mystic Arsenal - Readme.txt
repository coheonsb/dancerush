F.A.Q.:
------------------

Q: I think this pack is missing something / This pack doesn't have an effect like this

A: If you have any suggestions for additional content, feel free to send me an e-mail.

----------------------------------------

Q: My impact effects rotation is odd!

A: Some of the impact effects default rotation is set to impact at a floor.
This means you will have to script the impact effect to be rotated according to the surface direction.
